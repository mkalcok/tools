lock you out of remote access. It applies ${b}NEW_RULES${nob} and waits (by default) 30 seconds,
if it's not canceled by user within this period it will reload ${b}OLD_RULES${nob}. You can cancel
this script by issuing SIGINT (usualy ^C).

Usage: fw-try [OPTIONS] -i NEW_RULES [-o OLD_RULES]

ARGUMENTS:
